      <p className="beans-intro"> Beans offers on demand affirmations when you need them most. We talk to ourselves through our thoughts and inner monologue more than anyone else talks to us. It is so important to find ways to improve our mindset and speak kindly to ourselves, or risk falling into negative thought patterns. Our thoughts and how we talk to ourselves plays a large role in our overall success and happiness. Beans affirmations are positive statements that can help you to challenge and overcome self-sabotaging and negative thoughts. When you repeat them often, and believe in them, you can start to make positive changes.</p>
